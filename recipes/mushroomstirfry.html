            <br> mushroom stir-fry features a medley of mushrooms: shiitakes for meaty texture and earthy</br>
             flavor,and beech and enoki mushrooms for visual appeal and textural interest. Who needs meat? The
             <br> recipe makes just enough sauce to coat the vegetables, but feel free to double the sauce</br>
             ingredients if you'd like extra to serve over rice or noodles.
